# jFuzzyLogic-Parking
This academic project consist on an implementation of a *Fuzzy Inference System* representing the process of *parking a truck*.

The truck is represented as a red rectangle, and starting at a certain position (random each simulation), must finish at x=50, and phi=90 (perpendicular). The way it ends up at the correct position uses certain **rules**. These are defined in the file *src/fcl/Parking.fcl*.

One possible simulation could be as follows:
